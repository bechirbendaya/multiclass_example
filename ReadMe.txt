# Sweeping Behavior Modeling Example

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to map geolocation data from an operational sweeping machine and transform it into sweeping behavior using a combination of transformation heuristics and multiclass classification steps.

## Project Description

The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate a robust approach to modeling the behavior of sweeping operations using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores how raw GPS data can be systematically transformed into categorized states: sweeping, idle, and moving. This process involves two key transformation heuristics and two stages of multiclass classification, showcasing the effectiveness of these methods in handling complex real-world data.

## Project Structure

- **Example_Sweeping_Shift_Param.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all the necessary code and documentation.
- **data/**: This directory should contain the datasets used in the notebook, assuming they are needed for the analysis.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview and setup instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the notebook, or use an IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks.
3. Navigate to the repository's directory and launch the Jupyter Notebook to open `Example_Sweeping_Shift_Param.ipynb`.
4. Install necessary Python libraries required for the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Requirements

This project relies on several Python libraries, including `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib` for plotting, and `scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning models. Make sure these are installed in your Python environment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the model, additional analyses, or bug fixes, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
